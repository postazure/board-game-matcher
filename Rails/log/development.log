With <br/>suspicions running high, the Citizens choose a person to lynch each day.<br/><br/>Objective<br/>Good and Evil are at odds.  The Citizens must attempt to rid the village of all the evil players by lynching who they suspect to be causing the nighttime murders. If the village is successful <br/>in lynching all the Werewolves, Witches or Demons during the day, the Citizens win!  If the Evil players succeed in killing all the Citizens, they are victorious!<br/><br/>Components<br/>Dark Village is played with a deck of cards that includes 10 Evil roles and 26 Citizen roles.<br/>          <br/>Setup<br/>A game of Dark Village is easy to get started. Just gather a group of people and have them sit in a circle.  You can be just about anywhere&hellip;on chairs, on the ground, around a table, or on the couches in the family room.  A person who is familiar with the game is chosen as the Narrator.  Cards to be used are <br/>chosen with there being around one Evil player for every 3 Citizens.  The Narrator deals each player a card that becomes their secret role for the game.  A basic game begins with a Narrator, 2 Evil characters and 6 Citizens.<br/><br/>Roles<br/> Narrator<br/> Citizens (Good village folk)<br/> Werewolves, Witches, and Demons (Evil villagers who win by killing off and outnumbering Citizens)<br/> Seer/Detective (Citizen-sided, can inspect for Evil members)<br/> Doctor (Citizen-sided, can choose a player to save at night)<br/><br/>Nightfall&hellip;<br/>The Narrator begins the game by having everyone close their eyes and be silent.  He controls all the actions in the form of a story. (&ldquo;Nighttime has fallen and all the village has <br/>gone to sleep&hellip;&rdquo;) This begins the nighttime phase of the game. Each night, the Narrator has characters awake and perform their actions. He instructs the Werewolves to &ldquo;awake&rdquo; (open their eyes) and see their fellow members.  They kill off one of the Citizens by silently gesturing who they choose.  They must all be in agreement. The Narrator asks one Werewolf to gesture his <br/>battle sign and makes note of it.  The narrator then has the Werewolves go back to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; (close their eyes). The Narrator, then, instructs the Seer to &ldquo;awake&rdquo;. The Seer points at a player he suspects of being Evil. The Narrator nods if the Seer is correct.  The Narrator has the Seer go back to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo;. The Narrator, next, instructs the Doctor to awake and select a person to save.  The doctor silently points at a player goes back to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo;. Last, the Narrator instructs all Citizens to gesture their battle sign and makes note of the sign of the player who was attacked.<br/><br/>Daybreak&hellip;<br/>The Narrator has everyone &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; to begin the daytime phase.  <br/>Unless the Doctor has saved the player the Werewolves attacked or the player has defeated the Werewolves with his battle sign, a murder is announced to the group.  The Narrator tells a story of that character&rsquo;s death.  The dead player may no longer participate in the game in any way.  All the players may now discuss who they suspect as one of the killers.  After enough time has passed, the Narrator calls for a vote on who the village will lynch.  The majority vote causes that player to be hung and killed at dusk.<br/><br/>The Second Night<br/>The Narrator continues the night and day phases until, all the Citizens or all the Evil players have been killed.<br/><br/>Winning<br/>When either all Good or all Evil is left, the game is over and that group wins. Remember, even though you may die, the things you said might provide valuable information to help your group win.<br/><br/>Battle<br/>A Battle occurs between the Werewolves and the player they attack.  A player may only use a sign that is shown on their card.  The outcome is decided by one of the most basic <br/>systems known to man:<br/> Paper beats Rock<br/> Rock beats Scissors<br/> Scissors beat Paper   <br/> Evil wins all ties<br/><br/>Additional Roles<br/>Dark Village includes several additional roles to enhance traditional gameplay. <br/> Priest &ndash; Sees the role of a dead player each night<br/> Mason &ndash; Learns the identity of the other Mason <br/> Dentist &ndash; Every third night chooses a player to silence for one day<br/> Star-Crossed Lover &ndash; Chooses a lover the first night.  If one dies, both die.<br/> Fortune Teller &ndash; learns one player&rsquo;s role a night<br/> Hunter &ndash; Kills another player when he dies.<br/> Peeping Tom &ndash; May peek while the Evil players are &ldquo;awake&rdquo;<br/> Thief &ndash; Steals the role of one player the first night.  The player is dealt a new role.<br/> Lawyer &ndash; Chooses one person to save from lynching each night<br/> Sheriff &ndash; Vote to lynch counts twice<br/> Farmer &ndash; If the farmer dies, the Citizens have 3 days before they starve and die<br/> Scholar &ndash;  learns if an Evil is beside him<br/> Scientist &ndash; learns the number of  Evil alive<br/> Magician &ndash; Dies on second successful attack<br/> Village Idiot &ndash; May only speak gibberish<br/> Gravedigger &ndash; Buries a player alive during day<br/> Serial Killer &ndash; Kills at night on his own. Not part of either group.<br/> Psychiatrist &ndash; Suspects one player of being the Serial Killer each night. If correct, the Serial Killer is &ldquo;cured&rdquo; and becomes a normal Citizen.<br/><br/>Based on Mafia by Dimitry Davidoff and Werewolf by Andrew Plotkin<br/><br/>"], ["image", "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1418889.png"], ["max_players", 30], ["min_players", 7], ["player_age", 12], ["playing_time", 45], ["title", "D"], ["updated_at", "2015-02-15 07:49:51.182379"], ["year", 2011]]

Barricades get rerolled, drawing up to 5 more dice to roll each turn.<br/><br/>You may stop any time and return to your lair, eating the number of Villagers on the board.

Wizard's Magic vanquishes the dragon, ending your turn with 0 points. Without 2 Knights, he counts as a Villager.<br/><br/>If you roll a Dragon (the other specialty dice), you cast your Fire Breath attack. This burns all Barricades, revealing the delicious Villager goodness inside. It also melts the armor of 1 Knight, taking that die out of play. Then the Dragon also goes out of play. Count the Villagers and return to your lair or continue your turn, at your choice.<br/><br/>Play continues until some dragon/player has eaten 15 or more Villagers and is satiated.

The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.

The deck consists of numbered cards from 2 - 15. Several cards have special abilities or act as wild cards.<br/><br/>In round one, whoever has the Start card (a 4) begins play. Each player must then play one or two cards of a higher number. Play continues clockwise. The first player to discard all of their cards becomes the Mayor and scores 5 points.

From the remaining cards, players choose one and pass the rest, and so on, until no cards are left to pass.<br/><br/>From those cards, players simultaneously play one card into one of the four districts of their village (north, south, east, and west).

Your strategies, risks, and fortune can transform your village into a thriving city or forgotten ruins.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Villagers and Villains is a card game with over 100 unique cards. The game is played over several rounds. Each round has 6 distinct Phases. During each Phase, all players (Mayors) have a chance to take specific actions. The Mayor who builds the most successful village wins.<br/><br/>Game play: <br/>Villagers and Villains is a building game. In the 1st phase players recruit cards from a common pool neutral to all players. 4 classes of cards could appear in the pool: Challenges, citizens, buildings, and heroes. Each card has different game play applications and different effects on end scoring. In the 2nd phase each player has a chance to defend their town from challenges. In the 3rd phase challenges loot towns left unprotected. The 4th phase is when each town earns money. In the 5th phase money can be spent to expand a town by hiring heroes and citizens or creating buildings. The final phase resets the board for a new round of phases. The starting player changes and rounds continue until a town reaches a fixed size. At that time the game is scored.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/>In the end each town is scored based on a variety of facets and features. Players have to assess which facet will score the most points as the game is played--and circumstances dictate.<br/><br/>Features: <br/>The game ships with a basic and advanced version for experienced and novice gamers and special 2-player game rules. In the advanced game players gain access to the king's favor, special card powers, and pairing options for final scoring. In addition, the home site offers a variety of rules variations for added game play. While chance plays a part in the game (via a die-roll for certain elements) choices in recruiting, and how to use town's abilities and resources play a large role.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/>100 different playing cards (challenges, citizens, heroes, buildings)<br/>10 starting cards (5 citizens, 5 angry mobs)<br/>a die<br/>1 kings favor token<br/>1 start marker<br/>1 score pad<br/>2 punch-out sheets of gold coin tokens<br/>rules sheet.<br/><br/>"], ["image", "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1066374.jpg"], ["max_players", 5], ["min_players", 2], ["player_age", 9], ["playing_time", 30], ["title", "V"], ["updated_at", "2015-02-15 07:50:17.900054"], ["year", 2011]]

Unfortunately, that means you have to do all the bookkeeping on paper that the computer could do easily.  Most players will find it a bit tedious to constantly have to calculate and record population, crops, seed, food, weapons, etc.  However, we sometimes play it at a restaurant while waiting for the food to come - it's not a bad way to pass the time, really, when you don't have less portable games around.<br/><br/>The game consists of a rules/events booklet, three six-sided dice, and a pad of record sheets.  The game is set in a mythical Renaissance-era kingdom, with each player playing a separate village in that kingdom.  You can trade goods with each other each turn, but can only attack others when you roll a &quot;1&quot; for an event table.<br/><br/>To play, each player takes a record sheet (you may need more than one per person, depending on how long the game lasts) and a pencil.  Determine first player, and write down your starting village: 5 each of people, gold, land, food, and seed.  The seed can go into either the ground as crops or storage - you should have some of each for safety.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she rolls the three dice.  The red die tells you which table to look under: Attacks, Catastrophes, Good Times, Mixed Events, All Players Involved, or More Mixed Events.  The green (or yellow in some sets) die is then the &quot;tens&quot; digit, and the white die the &quot;ones&quot; digit.  So a roll of 5, 4, 1 means you look at event #41 on table 5.  (That's a bad one, a plague, but it's bad for everybody ...)<br/><br/>Once a player has resolved an event, ALL players Harvest crops, make weapons, get people, eat food, barter with other players or the King, store food and seed, plant seed - record this on your sheet with a pencil.  You assign your people to weapon making or harvesting - they can't do both in the same turn.  Then the next player takes their turn at the event table, after which ALL players repeat the harvest, weapons, food, seed, etc.  This is the part that drives some people crazy - there's a LOT of record keeping.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player reaches either 20 land units, 200 gold, or reaches a population of 35 people.  If you do one of these, you win.<br/><br/>"], ["image", "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic46446.jpg"], ["max_players", 6], ["min_players", 2], ["player_age", 10], ["playing_time", 1], ["title", "V"], ["updated_at", "2015-02-15 07:50:20.902491"], ["year", 1991]]

As a mighty king, you have a grand opportunity to expand your empire by building new villages here. Unfortunately, many of your fellow rulers also hope to stake their claim in this new world. Whose villages will stand, and whose will fall?<br/><br/>Each card has a gold value, and your goal is to earn 100 gold pieces across multiple rounds by building villages. Do this by collecting three unit cards of the same color and laying them down. If an enemy puts down a card you'd like to have, it's time for battle! Send out your village's finest hero or hire one in secret by playing it face-down from your hand, and your opponent will do the same. Play the stronger card, and you'll be able to take a prisoner from your enemy's village and make it part of your own.<br/><br/>However, it's not enough to simply send your most powerful units to attack neighboring kingdoms. Each unit has its own winning strategies: knights excel at defense, the wizard's power falters only when facing enemies of the same color, the dragon's strength increases with each enemy he defeats, and heroes become much stronger when you're in last place. These are only a few of the 15 different unit types you'll command. With the right combination of luck and skill, you'll always come out on top.<br/><br/>War is one way to expand your empire, but it is certainly not the only way. Perhaps you'd like to avoid conflict altogether. Take on the role of a benevolent king who gives freely to other players, and you'll win bonus gold for being the first to empty their hand and end the round.

Villages and cities give victory points.<br/><br/>When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge.<br/><br/>There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:<br/><br/><br/>     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),<br/>     a bonus resource,<br/>     an attack if a player has too many resources, and<br/>     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     <br/><br/><br/>There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. 42 of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns.

Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>The game changes the base game in three main ways:<br/><br/>First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.<br/><br/>Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)<br/><br/>Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded.

First, instead of having only a single island in the game on which players build and compete for resources, three islands are present &ndash; but the landscape of only one of these islands is known at the start of the game. Players start on this island, then build ships and bring settlers into play so that they can then travel to new lands. When a ship ends its movement on unexplored territory, that hex is revealed and a randomly-drawn number chip placed on it, with the player earning one resource as a reward &ndash; assuming the hex produces resources, that is. (The number of unknown tiles varies from 16 to 32, depending on the scenario.) A settler and ship can be transformed into a port settlement, from which roads and new ships can be built to enable further exploration.<br/><br/>Second, instead of using cities, Catan: Explorers &amp; Pirates allows players to build port settlements for two corn and two ore, with a port settlement supplying one resource when the adjacent number is rolled at the start of a turn. Like cities, port settlements are worth two victory points (VPs), and the number of VPs required to win depends on the scenario.<br/><br/>Third, if a player receives no resources during the production roll (other than on a roll of 7), she receives one gold in compensation. Two gold can be traded with the bank for a resource of the player's choice. Gold has other uses as well, such as helping you escape from pirates.<br/><br/>The five scenarios included in Catan: Explorers &amp; Pirates are:<br/><br/>&bull; Land Ho! Explore the seas of Catan and discover two new islands to expand your settlements. Once you've discovered an island, you must use ships to ferry settlers from one island to another and colonize distant lands. (Introductory scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Pirate Lairs! In this scenario, pirates prowl the seas along with your trading vessels. Pay tribute to the pirates or drive them off, then find and capture their lairs to earn gold and VPs! (One mission scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Fish for Catan! The people of Catan are short of food, so it's time to take to the ocean to fish for meals. These are deep water fish, though, so first you must find their shoals before you can catch them! The Council of Catan will reward players with VPs for returning fish to the island, as well as for capturing pirate lairs. Just watch out for roaming pirates, as not only will they demand gold for tribute, they might also get to the fish before you do! (Two mission scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Spices for Catan! In this scenario, the Council of Catan wants you to find fish and spices for the people of Catan! As before, they reward the most industrious merchant captains with VPs. Obtaining spice will require you to become friends with the mysterious inhabitants of the Spice Islands, but in return they will not only trade you spices but teach you their knowledge of sailing or even pirate fighting techniques!

Catan: Junior introduces a modified playing style of the classic Settlers of Catan, giving players as young as five a perfect introduction to the Catan series of games.<br/><br/>Catan: Junior takes place on a ring of islands where 2 to 4 players build hideouts and encounter the mysterious Spooky Island, where the Ghost Captain lives. Each island generates a specific resource: wood, goats, molasses or swords, and players can acquire gold. Each player starts with two pirate hideouts on different islands, and they can use the resources they acquire to build ships, hideouts or get help from Coco the Parrot. By building ships, they can expand their network; the more hideouts they build, the more resources they may receive. Just watch out for the dreaded Ghost Captain!<br/><br/>Be the first player to control seven pirate hideouts, and you win!<br/><br/>What sets this apart from the previous Die Siedler von Catan: Junior:<br/><br/>    This game is playable with two as it comes with a two-player map.<br/>    The three- and four-player map is larger and is more symmetrical, so that two of the colors don't operate at a disadvantage.<br/>    The map now shows die faces rather than numbers for resource production.<br/>    Many of the event cards have been removed to make the game simpler.<br/>    There are no cards in the game only tiles for more durability.<br/>    There are no longer harbors in the game. In the original game you had to set up the board with random secret harbor tiles that allow for better trades with the bank. Now the trading to the bank is simpler and can be done from the beginning and doesn't require people to build to the harbors.<br/>    The resources are different.<br/>    There is a race for the Coco the Parrot tiles (rather than 'CoCo Helps' cards) and those that have the most get to put an extra piece on the board (one step closer to winning), tied players take their piece off the island and leave it vacated.<br/>    The market is now a part of the board, and can be traded into only once on your turn<br/>    By default, Trading with other players is excluded and only part of the &quot;advanced game&quot;.  In Die Siedler von Catan: Junior trading with other players could be excluded to simplify the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As in Die Siedler von Catan: Junior you can't chain ships, you must build a pirate lair before continuing on.<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Die Siedler von Catan: Junior<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"], ["image", "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1332510.jpg"], ["max_players", 4], ["min_players", 2], ["player_age", 6], ["playing_time", 30], ["playing_time_max", 30], ["playing_time_min", 30], ["title", "Catan: Junior"], ["updated_at", "2015-02-15 08:07:31.971066"], ["year", 2012]]

An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.<br/><br/>Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.<br/><br/>The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.<br/><br/>Ways to Play:<br/>The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/>The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.  These eras are known as &quot;The Era of Gold,&quot; &quot;The Era of Turmoil,&quot; and &quot;The Era of Progress.&quot;<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>"], ["image", "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic850850.jpg"], ["max_players", 2], ["min_players", 2], ["player_age", 10], ["playing_time", 45], ["playing_time_max", 45], ["playing_time_min", 45], ["title", "Die Fürsten von Catan"], ["updated_at", "2015-02-15 08:07:56.453401"], ["year", 2010]]

You throw one heck of a party and you invite all who want to come and join in. And when they leave, you give them a thank-you present.<br/><br/>On the 10th of September 2005, the Deutsche Spielemuseum (the German Game Museum and brainchild of Peter Lemcke) celebrated in style in its current hometown of Chemnitz, in the German state of Saxony, by attempting to break a world record in conjunction with that other birthday kid, the &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot;. A more than 300 meter long game table was erected, offering room for 1000 Settler players, who all could participate on one gigantic Settlers map, using 17,500 Settlers' hexagons in the process. As it happened, 816 participants sat down to invade the ribbon island and the record stood.<br/><br/>To mark the occasion, a commemorative Settler expansion, themed on the German state of Saxony, was issued by Kosmos, in a limited edition of 1000, one for each participant. Klaus Teuber was on hand to sign his life away.<br/><br/>Saggsen Gadan presented two new scenarios for Settlers, both requiring game pieces from the basic set to play. Special game pieces needed for these Saxony scenarios were also included, ready to cut out. Instead of the usual variable game-set-up of the basic game, the two scenarios both use a ready-made map. There is one scenario map printed on each side of the expansion sheet, in the same vein as the game boards from boxed historical theme set expansions.<br/><br/>1. Saggsen-Gadan:<br/>For this game variant, players must colonize Saggsen using the usual building and resource trading mechanisms. Through progressive development, different manufacturers can be founded, whose products subsequently can be turned into victory points. But be warned: Saggsen is sliced up by many rivers, that can only be crossed at bridges. To become King of Saggsen you will have to make your influence count in the seven regions of the state. Who is the first to obtain 10 victory points?<br/><br/>2. Catan-Offensive in Chemnitz - a quick scenario for 2-3 players:<br/>By utilizing the resources obtained through building and trading, players aim to populate the city of Chemnitz bit by bit. As the game progresses, players can obtain colorful postcards of historical buildings, museums and leisure facilities. These postcards can then be exchanged for victory points. Karl Marx, after whom the city was known in its East German days when it was called Karl-Marx-Stadt, now takes over the role of Joker/Robber.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    The Settlers of Catan<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"], ["image", "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic118001.jpg"], ["max_players", 4], ["min_players", 2], ["player_age", 0], ["playing_time", 30], ["playing_time_max", 30], ["playing_time_min", 30], ["title", "S"], ["updated_at", "2015-02-15 08:07:59.592213"], ["year", 2005]]

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards) - wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone - to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.<br/><br/>Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think, houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.<br/><br/>A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities - think, hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.<br/><br/>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.<br/><br/>The Settlers of Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.<br/><br/>Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by Kosmos and has gone through multiple editions.

Pirate warehouses are equivalent to settlements in Catan, and the player receive resources from these warehouses whenever a die roll matches the number showing on that island. These resources take the form of equipment cards, and the resources are wood, wool, rum, sabers and gold. With these, players construct ships and more pirate warehouses or buy development cards. Instead of a robber, players must now beware of a Ghost Pirate, which can block the resources normally provided by a warehouse.<br/><br/>Each player starts with two pirate warehouses, and the first player to build seven warehouses wins. In order to build a new warehouse, however, a player must go by ship from an existing warehouse to a new construction site, which thus keeps players alternating between constructing ships and warehouses.<br/><br/>Aside from the change in theme, other changes between The Settlers of Catan and Catan: Junior include the elimination of cities (i.e., warehouses can't be upgraded) and the distance rule between settlements, resources allocated by the roll of one die instead of a pair of D6s, and the introduction of a marketplace that allows trading with the bank. At the start of the game, one equipment card of each type is placed in the marketplace; on a player's turn, he can exchange one card in hand for a card in the marketplace.

Players collect and trade these resources &ndash; dilithium, tritanium, food, oxygen and water &ndash; in order to build Starships that connect regions in the galaxy, establish more Outposts and Starbases (upgraded Outposts) at new intersection points in order to increase resource acquisition, and acquire Development Cards that provide Victory Points (VPs) or special abilities.<br/><br/>On a dice roll of 7, a Klingon ship swoops in to prevent resource production on one planet while taxing spacegoers who hold too many resources.<br/><br/>Star Trek: Catan differs from the basic Settlers in one aspect: a set of Support Cards formerly available only in German as Catan Scenarios: Helpers of Catan. Each Support Card features a special ability and one of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Chapel, Rand, or Sarek. Some special abilities make basic actions better, such as reducing the costs of Starbase upgrades or allowing the player to trade a resource of their choice at 2:1 for a turn, while others break rules, such as protecting the player from discarding on a 7 or producing a resource when the player rolls a number that wouldn't otherwise produce for them. Players get a specific Support Card during setup based on turn order, with later players getting generally more useful abilities to compensate for early player advantage. When a player uses a Support Card ability for the first time, they may trade it in for a Support Card of their choice or keep it for a second use, but they may only trade immediately after use.<br/><br/>"], ["image", "//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1365413.jpg"], ["max_players", 4], ["min_players", 3], ["player_age", 10], ["playing_time", 75], ["playing_time_max", 75], ["playing_time_min", 75], ["title", "Star Trek Catan"], ["updated_at", "2015-02-15 08:08:37.615706"], ["year", 2012]]
